## Welcome to the Kubernetes Storm Center ðŸ‘‹ Let's take the fear out of threats (by understanding them)

We want to enable (truly) free and open source threat intelligence for the cloud native ecosystem.


Keeping it simple, such that many non-experts can instrument their existing cluster-templates, stream and collect the information of how attackers traverse their "honeycluster", and publish their threat intelligence.

These "honeyclusters" can be used to pro-actively test also perceived or modelled threats on a continuous improvement mindset.

It should be noted, that a large usecase is to "simulate" the attack by using synthetic attacks (attack yourself) to test if a team can a) detect and b) defend and c) incident respond (as required by e.g. NIS-2).

Contributions, ideas and discussions from the cloud-native community are very welcome. We encourage users to report any issues.

There is a SLACK for the community [https://join.slack.com/t/k8sstorm/signup]
