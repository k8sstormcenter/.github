## Welcome to the Kubernetes Storm Center 👋

We want to enable (truly) free and open source threat intelligence for the cloud native ecosystem.

Keeping it simple, such that many non-experts can instrument their existing cluster-templates, stream and collect the information of how attackers traverse their "honeycluster", and publish their threat intelligence.

Contributions, ideas and discussions from the cloud-native community are very welcome.

This is a not-for-profit community project (with absolutely no liability)
