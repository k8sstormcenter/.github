## Welcome to the Kubernetes Storm Center ðŸ‘‹ Let's take the fear out of threats (by understanding them)

We want to enable (truly) free and open source threat intelligence for the cloud native ecosystem.


Keeping it simple, such that many non-experts can instrument their existing cluster-templates, stream and collect the information of how attackers traverse their "honeycluster", and publish their threat intelligence.
What started with honeyclusters, became a project to instrument kubernetes for live adaptive detection, meaning to construct an algorithm of detection mechanisms to auto-tune the finding of interesting activity on a large and distributed system.


It should be noted, that a large usecase is to "simulate" the attack by using synthetic attacks (attack yourself) to test if a team can a) detect and b) defend and c) incident respond (as required by e.g. NIS-2). This is how the project became more of a SOC, then a honeytrapping system. The stack
can be used for both, and you are solely responsible for taking adequate care - however you choose to instrument your infrastructure. Usage of this software can be destructive or have side-effects.

Contributions, ideas and discussions from the cloud-native community are very welcome. We encourage users to report any issues. Sample livelabs may be found on the iximiuz-labs platform.
