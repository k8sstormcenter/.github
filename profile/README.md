## Welcome to the Kubernetes Storm Center ðŸ‘‹

We want to enable (truly) free and open source threat intelligence for the cloud native ecosystem.

Keeping it simple, such that many non-experts can instrument their existing cluster-templates, stream and collect the information of how attackers traverse their "honeycluster", and publish their threat intelligence.

Contributions, ideas and discussions from the cloud-native community are very welcome.

There is a SLACK for the community [https://join.slack.com/t/k8sstorm/shared_invite/zt-2hulzsqh1-mnZL6fGFZiVLrOcqeTObIA](https://join.slack.com/t/k8sstorm/shared_invite/zt-2ma41wrv4-DWQlLAb6nhfZ2afHdE59Ww)
